The Odoo Community Association, OCA, is a membership based organization, established in 2013 to promote and support collaborative Odoo ERP solutions and to foster open source excellence. We make Odoo mightier, together.
The OCA brings people from around the world together to create reliable, high quality Odoo apps and modules that are easily accessible. We provide frameworks to rigorously test every OCA app so it works and is more secure. We help members to improve programming skills through teamwork, code-sprints, and community forums, and support you to connect with peers from across the globe to build your reputation and your personal and professional relationships. 

OCA is an independent legal non-profit entity. This lets members and non-members contribute open source code, funding, and other resources with the knowledge that your contributions will be maintained for public benefit. All OCA projects are freely available and usable under an OSI-certified Open Source license.

As a non-profit entity, the association has no shareholders. The OCA is managed collectively by a board of directors who are elected by delegate members.
