What is Apikzilla?

Apikzilla is a **cross-platform command-line tool** (CLI) for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**, connected to our hosting platform.

It allows you to:
- list available backups for a client project,
- download a backup from the platform,
- upload a backup to a client project.

In short, it serves as the single entry point for managing Odoo backups outside the hosting platform web interface.
