# 2. Engineering Philosophy

Apik’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that software engineering is not an act of production — it is an act of responsibility.  
Our role is to build systems that remain understandable, maintainable, and trustworthy over time.

This philosophy guides every project, every review, and every release.  
It defines how we design, collaborate, and improve as a team of engineers.

## 2.1. Purpose

This document sets the principles that shape our engineering culture.  
It translates our collective values into practical expectations for developers, Technical Referents, and the Quality team.

It is not a manifesto.  
It is a framework — a set of commitments that help us deliver stable, transparent, and ethical systems.

## 2.2. Foundational Values

### **Simplicity**
Simplicity is not minimalism. It is the discipline of clarity.  
Every line of code, every process, and every tool must serve a clear purpose.  
Complexity is tolerated only when it brings proportional value.  
Readable code is always more valuable than clever code.

### **Predictability**
Predictability is the foundation of trust — between developers, between teams, and with clients.  
Predictable code behaves the same in every environment.  
Predictable processes ensure that what we test is what we deploy.  
No surprises is the best compliment a system can receive.

### **Reproducibility**
Anything we do must be reproducible: from a single command, from versioned code, from a documented process.  
A developer’s setup, a backup restore, or a release deployment — all must yield the same result, every time.  
Reproducibility is our guarantee of technical integrity.

### **Resilience**
Resilience means designing for failure, not against it.  
We expect systems, processes, and humans to fail occasionally.  
Our duty is to make those failures recoverable, auditable, and non-destructive.  
A resilient system degrades gracefully and heals transparently.

### **Responsibility**
Each commit, review, and release is a decision with impact.  
Responsibility means owning that impact — technical, functional, and ethical.  
The Technical Referent ensures coherence, but quality is a collective duty.  
We do not seek to move fast; we seek to move well.

## 2.3. Our Engineering Ethic

We believe that:
- **Code is communication before computation.** It must express intent, not ego.
- **Testing is part of thinking.** It is how we prove that what we wrote is what we meant.
- **Technical debt is a shared choice.** When we take shortcuts, we document and own them.
- **Review is collaboration, not judgment.** It is how we learn, align, and grow.
- **English is our working language.** All code, comments, commit messages, and documentation must be written in English. This ensures clarity across teams, clients, and external contributors — even if Apik is a French company.

We value precision over perfection.  
Perfection is rare; clarity is repeatable.

---

## 2.4. Collaborative Spirit

At Apik, collaboration is structured and deliberate.  
The Quality team ensures consistency across projects.  
The **Technical Referent** guarantees technical coherence and validates releases.  
Project Managers coordinate delivery and client communication.  

Every participant — internal or external — shares the same expectations and responsibilities.  
Transparency and traceability are not optional; they are the foundation of trust.

We debate, we document, and we deliver together.

---

## 2.5. Long-Term Commitment

This philosophy is meant to last.  
It evolves as tools and practices evolve, but its foundation remains:  
clarity, predictability, and shared accountability.  

Our ambition is not to build quickly — it is to build **systems that endure**.  
Every technical choice we make should still make sense a year, or five years, later.
