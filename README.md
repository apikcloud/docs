## Overview

This repository hosts **Apikâ€™s internal engineering documentation** â€” our shared technical foundation for all teams.  
It defines our **development standards**, **workflows**, **tooling**, and **infrastructure guidelines**, ensuring coherence and quality across projects.

The full documentation lives in the `/docs` directory and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://apikcloud.github.io/docs/](https://apikcloud.github.io/docs/)

---

## Philosophy

Every developer should be able to understand, extend, or debug any Apik project without friction.  
This documentation captures our collective know-how and evolves continuously through collaboration.

---

## Working Language

All documentation, code comments, and commit messages are written in **English**.  
French versions are generated automatically for internal readability when needed.

---

## Structure

- `/docs` â€” Core documentation (development, workflow, CI/CD, quality, infrastructure, etc.)  
- `/docs/_media` â€” Shared assets (logos, diagrams, images)  
- `/docs/_sidebar.md` â€” Documentation sidebar structure
- `/docs/index.html` â€” [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) configuration for live rendering
- `/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` â€” Aggregated documentation (auto-generated, do not edit manually)
- `/scripts` â€” Automation scripts for translation and aggregation
- `.github/workflows` â€” CI pipelines for translation, validation, and aggregation

The old `_module/` folder has been merged into a single file: `10-module.md`.

---

## Automation

Two main GitHub Actions maintain the documentation:

| Workflow | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Translate** | Generates a French version from the English source. (deactivated) |
| **Aggregate** | Builds a single Markdown file for offline use. |

---

## Contributing

This documentation is a **living reference**.  
All contributions must go through **Pull Request** review by the **Quality Team** and, when applicable, the **Technical Referent**.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep edits **concise**, **consistent**, and **in English**.  
- Reference related tickets or discussions in commit messages.
